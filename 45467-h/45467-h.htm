<h4>THE EVENING HOURS</h4>

<p style="margin-left: 25%;">
<a id="I"></a>I<br />
<br />
<br />
Tender flowers, light as the sea's foam,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Graced our garden way;</span><br />
The lapsing wind would give your hands caress<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with your hair would play.</span><br />
<br />
The shade was kind to our united steps<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That wandered soberly;</span><br />
And from the village a child's song arose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To fill infinity.</span><br />
<br />
Our ponds extended in the autumn light<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath the guarding reed,</span><br />
And the wood's forehead showed its mobile crown<br />
To pools upon the mead.<br />
<br />
And we, who knew our hearts were murmuring<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In union but one prayer,</span><br />
Thought that it was our peaceful life the eve<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Showed unveiled there.</span><br />
<br />
Supremely then you saw the sky aglow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For a farewell caress;</span><br />
And long and long you looked on it with eyes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Filled with mute tenderness.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="II"></a>II<br />
<br />
<br />
If it be true<br />
That garden flower or meadow tree<br />
May hold still any memory<br />
Of lovers past who once looked on<br />
Their splendour or their purity,<br />
So shall our love return once more<br />
In that long hour of long regret<br />
To give the rose, or in the oak restore,<br />
Its sweetness or its strength,<br />
Ere death come yet.<br />
<br />
Thus shall it survive unconquered<br />
Within the glory that belongs to simple things,<br />
And find a joy again, in light that cleaves<br />
The sky on summer break of day,<br />
And find a joy again<br />
In the sweet rain<br />
That dwells in drops on hanging leaves.<br />
<br />
And if on some fair eve, from depths of space,<br />
Should come two lovers hand in hand,<br />
The oak, like a large and puissant wing<br />
Would reach its shadow out to where they stand,<br />
And the rose would give them of its perfumed grace.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="III"></a>III<br />
<br />
<br />
Dead is the glycin and the hawthorne flower;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But now is the time when heather-bloom is seen,</span><br />
And on this so calm eve the rustling wind<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brings you the fragrance of the starved Campine.</span><br />
<br />
Love and breathe them, thinking of its fate;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over that rugged soil the storm-wind lives;</span><br />
Sand and sea have made of it their prey,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet of the little left, it ever gives.</span><br />
<br />
Of old, though autumn came, we dwelled with it,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With plain and forest, with the storm and light,</span><br />
Until the angels of the Christmas time<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Inscribed its legend with their winged flight.</span><br />
<br />
Your heart became more simple and more sure;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We loved the villagers and the forlorn</span><br />
Old women who would speak of their great age<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And of old spinning-wheels their hands had worn.</span><br />
<br />
Our quiet house upon the misty heath<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Was frank and welcoming to all who came;</span><br />
Its roof was dear to us, its door and sill,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And hearth long blackened by familiar flame.</span><br />
<br />
When over vast, pale, measureless repose<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The total splendour of the night was set,</span><br />
A lesson of deep silence we received,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose ardour never shall our souls forget.</span><br />
<br />
Since we were more alone amid the plain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The dawn and evening entered more our thought,</span><br />
Our eyes were franker and our hearts more sweet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And with the world's desire more fully fraught.</span><br />
<br />
We found content in not exacting it;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The sadness, even, of the days was kind,</span><br />
And the rare sunlight of the autumn's end<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Charmed us the more that it seemed weak and blind.</span><br />
<br />
Dead is the glycin and the hawthorne flower;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But now are the days when heather-bloom is seen,</span><br />
Remember these, and let the rustling wind<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bring you the fragrance of the starved Campine.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="IV"></a>IV<br />
<br />
<br />
Draw your chair to mine<br />
And stretch your hands to the hearth',<br />
That I may see between your fingers<br />
Shine<br />
The ancient flame;<br />
And look upon the fire<br />
Quietly, with your eyes<br />
That have no fear of any light,<br />
So that for me they be the same,<br />
Yet franker when the blaze leaps higher<br />
Making them as from deep within you, bright.<br />
<br />
Ah, how fair still is our life and fain!<br />
When the clock strikes out its notes of gold<br />
And I approach you and as a flower hold;<br />
And a fever slow and pure,<br />
Which we will not to restrain,<br />
Leads the kiss, marvellous and sure,<br />
From hand to brow, from brow to lips again.<br />
<br />
How well I love you, O my clear beloved,<br />
Your swooning body, caressing and caressed,<br />
In whose depth of joy I almost drown.<br />
All is more dear to me, your lips, your arms close-pressed,<br />
And your kind bosom whereon my tired head<br />
After the rapture you bestow, sinks down<br />
Quietly, near your heart to find its rest.<br />
<br />
I love you still more after love's sharp pain<br />
When your goodness still more sure and motherly<br />
Brings repose to passion's ardency,<br />
And, when desire has cried aloud its will,<br />
I hear approach familiar joy again,<br />
With steps that almost silence are, it is so still.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="V"></a>V<br />
<br />
<br />
Be kind and comforting to us, oh light!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And bathe our foreheads now, oh wintry ray!</span><br />
When we two issue forth this afternoon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To breathe together the last warmth of day.</span><br />
<br />
We loved you formerly with such a pride,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With such a love as our two souls could lend,</span><br />
That a supreme and sweet and friendly flame<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is due us now that we await the end.</span><br />
<br />
You are that which no man may forget,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From dawn that smites his arm unconquered</span><br />
To evening when you sleep within his eyes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your strength abolished and your splendour dead.</span><br />
<br />
Always for us you were the seen desire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Spreading through all, luminous and free,</span><br />
That with impassioned ardour deep and high<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seemed from our heart to seek infinity.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="VI"></a>VI<br />
<br />
<br />
Alas the time of crimson phlox is past<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And of proud roses brightening the gate.</span><br />
What matter? Still I love with all my heart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our garden, tho' deflow'red and desolate.</span><br />
<br />
More dear than are the joyous summer noons,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My garden is that now forlornly grieves;</span><br />
Oh the last perfumes languidly exhaled<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By a late flower in the lingering leaves!</span><br />
<br />
This evening I wandered in the paths<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over the plants my fervent touch to pass,</span><br />
And falling on my knees I pressed my lips<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To the wet earth among the trembling grass.</span><br />
<br />
And now that it is dying and the night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Has misted all the garden with its breath,</span><br />
My being that so dwells in all this ruin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shall learn to die in sharing thus its death.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="VII"></a>VII<br />
<br />
<br />
The evening falls, the moon is gold....<br />
<br />
Before the day is spent<br />
Go out and wander in the garden walks<br />
And pluck with gentle hands<br />
The few remaining flowers that on their stalks<br />
Are not yet sadly bent toward the mould.<br />
<br />
What matter if their foliage be wan?<br />
We still admire and love,<br />
And still their chalices are beautiful above<br />
The stems they rest upon.<br />
<br />
You wander mid the borders here and there<br />
Along a lonely path,<br />
And the flowers you bear<br />
Tremble in your hand that shudders as it takes.<br />
And now your dreamy fingers<br />
Reverently shape the sere<br />
Roses wherein autumn lingers,<br />
Weaving them with many a tear,<br />
Into a crown of pale, clear flakes.<br />
<br />
The last light dwells upon your eyes and brow<br />
And your slow steps are sad and quiet now....<br />
<br />
Slowly, at the vesper, through the gloam,<br />
With empty hands you wandered home,<br />
Leaving, upon a little humid mound,<br />
On the path that to our doorway led,<br />
The pale circlet that your fingers bound.<br />
And I knew that in our garden perished,<br />
Where winds now pass like cohorts over-head,<br />
You would give flower again for one last time,<br />
To our youth that lies upon the ground<br />
Dead....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="VIII"></a>VIII<br />
<br />
<br />
When you store away in fragrant shelves,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some autumn eve, the fruits of orchard trees,</span><br />
I seem to see you calmly ranging there<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our old, but fresh and perfumed memories.</span><br />
<br />
And love returns for them as once they were,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wind on lips and sunlight in my eyes;</span><br />
I see the vanished moments once again,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their joy, their mirth, their fevers and their cries.</span><br />
<br />
The past comes back to life with such desire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To be the present with its force again,</span><br />
That half-extinct fires burn with sudden flame,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My heart exults and swoons as though in pain.</span><br />
<br />
Oh fruits that glow amid the autumn shadows,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Jewels fallen from the summer's string</span><br />
Of gems, illumining our sombre hours,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What red awakening is this you bring!</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="IX"></a>IX<br />
<br />
<br />
Fallen is the leafage from above<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That covered all the garden with its shade;</span><br />
See, between the naked boughs far off<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The village roofs to the horizon fade.</span><br />
<br />
While summer flamed its joy, neither of us<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Saw them clustered there so near our home;</span><br />
But to-day, with leaf and flower dead,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Into our thinking they more often come.</span><br />
<br />
Others are living there behind those walls<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And those worn thresholds with the porch above,</span><br />
Having for only friends the wind and rain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the lighted lamp to give them love.</span><br />
<br />
In the fall of eve, when fires are lit,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the pauses of the clock they heed,</span><br />
Dear, as to us, the silence is to them,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The thoughts within their eyes that they may read.</span><br />
<br />
Those hours of intimacy naught disturbs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of tender and profound tranquillity,</span><br />
Blessing the instant past for having been<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And finding dearer yet the one to be.</span><br />
<br />
See how they hold between their trembling hands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A happiness of pain and pleasure born;</span><br />
Known to each the other's body old<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And aged eyes by the same sorrows worn.</span><br />
<br />
The flowers of their life, they love them faded,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The final perfume and the beauty brief,</span><br />
And heavy memory of glory waning,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Wasting in time's garden, leaf by leaf.</span><br />
<br />
Deep in their warmth of human feeling hid,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">From the winter sheltered and reduse,</span><br />
Nothing abases them or makes them pine<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And plead for days they are content to lose.</span><br />
<br />
The quiet folk of those old villages,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What neighbours are they to our happiness!</span><br />
And how we find our own tears in their eyes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our strength and ardour in their fearlessness!</span><br />
<br />
Down there, beneath their roofs, by windowside<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or seated by the glowing fireside, thus,</span><br />
Perhaps on such a night of wind and wet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">What we have thought of them they think of us.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="X"></a>X<br />
<br />
<br />
When the star-lit heaven broods above our house<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We sit in silence during many hours</span><br />
Beneath its soft intensity of light<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To feel more ardent still these selves of ours.</span><br />
<br />
The silver stars are drifting on their way;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath their flame and all their glistening</span><br />
The great night is deeper and more deep;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such calm there is, the sea is listening!</span><br />
<br />
What matter if the sea itself be still,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If in this infinity so fair,</span><br />
Pregnant now with yet unvisioned power,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our beating hearts make all the silence there?</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XI"></a>XI<br />
<br />
<br />
That very love which made you be for me<br />
A splendid garden wherein moving tree,<br />
Made shadow over sward and docile rose,<br />
Makes you the shelter where I now repose.<br />
<br />
There garnered are your flowers of desire,<br />
Your lucent goodness and your gentle fire;<br />
But all within a peace profound are furled<br />
Against harsh winter winds that scar the world.<br />
<br />
My happiness is warmed within your arms;<br />
Each little tender word you whisper charms<br />
My ear with as familiar a delight<br />
As in the time when lilacs blossomed white.<br />
<br />
Your clear and merry humour daily cheers<br />
And triumphs over the distress of years;<br />
And you yourself smile at the silver hairs<br />
That your lovely head so gaily wears.<br />
<br />
When to my searching kiss your head you bow,<br />
I care not for the lines that mark your brow,<br />
Nor for a vein that traces its bold line<br />
Upon your hands now safely held in mine.<br />
<br />
You fear not; and you know most certainly<br />
That nothing dies that dares love loyally,<br />
And that the flame which nourishes us so<br />
Feeds upon ruin's self that it may grow.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XII"></a>XII<br />
<br />
<br />
Those clear welcoming flowers along the wall's extent<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will be no longer waiting for us at our return;</span><br />
The silken waters that prolonged till they were spent,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Under a pure sweet sky no longer reach and yearn.</span><br />
<br />
Of our melancholy plains the flying birds are shy;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Over the marshes pale mists begin to crawl;</span><br />
Autumn, winter! Winter, autumn!&mdash;oh the cry!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the forest do you hear the dead wood fall?</span><br />
<br />
Our garden is no longer bridegroom of the light,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where once we saw the phlox in glorious surge and flare;</span><br />
Gladioli, in dust, once violent, upright,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Lingeringly have lain them down to perish there.</span><br />
<br />
All is without strength or beauty, without fire,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Fleeing and quailing and crumbling and passing sadly by;</span><br />
Oh, turn on me your eyes of light, for I desire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">There to seek a comer of our early sky!</span><br />
<br />
It is there alone our light may still abide,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The light that filled the garden once for you and me,</span><br />
Long ago, when our lily lifted its white pride<br />
And hollyhocks were an ascending ardency.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XIII"></a>XIII<br />
<br />
<br />
When the diamond grains of fresh snow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On our threshold lie,</span><br />
I hear your steps that come and go<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the room near by.</span><br />
<br />
You move the clear mirror that beside<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The window stood,</span><br />
And your bunch of keys strikes the drawer<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the chest of wood.</span><br />
<br />
I hear you stirring now the fire&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The live coal flares;</span><br />
And hear you place by silent walls<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The silent chairs.</span><br />
<br />
I hear you wipe the dust from objects<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As you pass,</span><br />
And your ring resounds against the side<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of a vibrant glass.</span><br />
<br />
And happier am I still, this eve,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With your presence dear&mdash;</span><br />
To feel you close, and not to see,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But always hear.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XIV"></a>XIV<br />
<br />
<br />
If fate has saved us from the banal sins<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of cowardly untruth and sad pretence,</span><br />
It is because we would have no constraint<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Whose yoke should bend our will with violence.</span><br />
<br />
Free and sunlit on your road you fared,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Strewing with flowers of will your flowers of love;</span><br />
Pausing to sustain me when my head<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bowed to the weight of doubt or fear above.</span><br />
<br />
Always you were of gesture kind and frank,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Knowing my heart for you forever burned;</span><br />
For if I loved another&mdash;could it be?&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Always it was to your heart I returned.</span><br />
<br />
So pure your eyes were in their weeping that<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My truth to you became my only lord;</span><br />
I spoke to you then sweet and sacred words,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your sorrow and your pardon were your sword.</span><br />
<br />
I fell asleep at evening on your breast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Glad with return from distance false and bleak</span><br />
To warmth of spring within us, glad within<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Your open arms captivity to seek.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XV"></a>XV<br />
<br />
<br />
No, my soul has never tired of you!<br />
<br />
In the time of June you said to me:<br />
"If I thought, beloved, if I thought<br />
That my love would ever weary you,<br />
With my sad thoughts and my lonely heart,<br />
No matter where, I should depart...."<br />
<br />
And sweetly sought the kiss I gave anew.<br />
<br />
And you said again:<br />
"One loses everything, life would repay;<br />
What though it be of gold,<br />
The chain<br />
That in one harbour's ring can hold<br />
Our human ships to-day?"<br />
<br />
And sweetly wept for pain you could not say.<br />
<br />
And you said<br />
Again and yet again:<br />
"Let us separate, before we be untrue;<br />
Our life's too pure and high<br />
To draw it out from fault to fault, and drain<br />
It wearily away...." You sought to fly<br />
From me whose desperate hands strove to retain.<br />
<br />
No, my soul has never tired of you!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XVI"></a>XVI<br />
<br />
<br />
Ah, we are happy still and proud to live<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">When the last ray, that's seen and then is lost,</span><br />
Brightens an instant the poor flowers of rime<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Engraved upon our window by the frost.</span><br />
<br />
Life leaps within us and hope sweeps us on;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And our garden, though it be now old,</span><br />
Though its paths be strewn with fallen boughs,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seems living, pure and dear and lit with gold.</span><br />
<br />
Something invades our blood, intrepid, bright,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And urges us to incarnate again</span><br />
Immense, full summer in the fervid kiss<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That desperately we give each other then.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XVII"></a>XVII<br />
<br />
<br />
Alas, must we accept the weight of years<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And find us nothing more than tranquil folk</span><br />
Who give each other infantile caress<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At eve, when hearth is quick with flame and smoke?</span><br />
<br />
Our dear belongings, shall they see us then<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Creeping from the hearth to wooden chest,</span><br />
To reach the window leaning on the wall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sitting to give our tottering bodies rest?</span><br />
<br />
If such a day must then affirm our ruin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And show the torpor brain or body fears,</span><br />
In spite of this fate we shall not complain,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But keep within our breasts our captive tears.</span><br />
<br />
For we shall guard these eyes of ours to watch<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For morn to follow night so pitiful,</span><br />
And see the sun of dawn burn on this life,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Making of earth itself a miracle.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XVIII"></a>XVIII<br />
<br />
<br />
All little facts, the things of no account,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A letter, date, an anniversary,</span><br />
A word that's spoken as on days long past,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Exalt, on these long evenings, you and me.</span><br />
<br />
We solemnise, we two, these simple things<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And count and recount all these gems of ours,</span><br />
So that what is left of our high selves<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">May face valiantly these sombre hours.</span><br />
<br />
And we are jealous more than it is meet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of these poor, gentle, friendly memories</span><br />
Who seat themselves with us beside the fire<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With winter flowers laid across thin knees.</span><br />
<br />
And the bread of happiness which once<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We did partake of, now they sit and eat;</span><br />
The bread on which our love has fed so long<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That now it finds the very crumbs are sweet.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XIX"></a>XIX<br />
<br />
<br />
Come to our threshold now, oh snow,<br />
Strew thy pallid ash,<br />
Oh peaceful and slow falling snow;<br />
The linden in the garden hangs its branches low<br />
And to the sky no flights of wood-larks go.<br />
<br />
Oh snow,<br />
Who warmest and dost shield<br />
The corn that is hardly sprung<br />
With the moss, with the down<br />
Strewn on the spreading field!<br />
Silent snow, oh friendly one<br />
To houses sleeping in the morning calm,<br />
Cover our roof and brush our window-frames;<br />
Oh luminous snow, into our very soul<br />
To find a way do thou not scorn,<br />
Snow that warmest still our last of dreams<br />
Like the springing corn.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XX"></a>XX<br />
<br />
<br />
When our clear garden lifted up its flow'rs<br />
The self-accusations made by each<br />
For failure of our love, broke into speech<br />
In passionate hours;<br />
And needed pardon offered and new peace<br />
And explanations of our miseries<br />
And tears that wet our sad and truthful eyes<br />
Gave love increase.<br />
But in these months of dreary rain<br />
When all retires to earth again,<br />
When even light is fain<br />
To find its war with darkness vain,<br />
No longer are our souls so strong and proud<br />
That, rapturously, they should confess aloud.<br />
<br />
In lowered voice our sins we say,<br />
Though still in tenderness, not scorn;<br />
But 'tis at twilight now and not at morn.<br />
Sometimes we even count them, wrong by wrong,<br />
Like things that one counts over<br />
And puts away;<br />
And their folly or their hurt to cover<br />
We argue long.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXI"></a>XXI<br />
<br />
<br />
With withered hands I touch your brow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And part your hair and kiss&mdash;(as the day dies</span><br />
And you are briefly sleeping by the hearth)<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beneath long lashes hid, your fervent eyes.</span><br />
<br />
Oh the dear tenderness of sinking day!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I think of the long years whose flight we saw,</span><br />
And suddenly your life in them appears<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So perfect that my love is filled with awe.</span><br />
<br />
And as in that time when we were betrothed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ardour again is in me and has brought</span><br />
Desire to kneel and touch your beating breast<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With fingers that are chaste as is my thought.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXII"></a>XXII<br />
<br />
<br />
Our hearts once burned in joyous days<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With love as luminous as high,</span><br />
But age to-day has made us weak<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With faults we dare deny.</span><br />
<br />
Thou dost not nourish us, oh will,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">By thine ardour in the strife,</span><br />
But soft benevolence alone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Colours now our life.</span><br />
<br />
We near thy brink of setting, Love,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And try to hide our frailty's pain</span><br />
In banal words and poor discourse<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of wisdom slow and vain.</span><br />
<br />
How sad the future then would be,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">If when our days grow wintrier</span><br />
There flame not forth the memory<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the proud souls we were.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXIII"></a>XXIII<br />
<br />
<br />
This wrinkled winter when the ruined sun<br />
Founders in the west and sinks below,<br />
I love to say your name, so grave and slow,<br />
While the clock strikes another day now done.<br />
<br />
And saying it so ravishes my voice<br />
That from my lips it sinks into my heart,<br />
And among all sweet words that there have part,<br />
Makes me the most ardently rejoice.<br />
<br />
And in the wind of dawn or evening's breath<br />
Changeless I reiterate the theme;<br />
Oh, think with what a passion, strong, supreme,<br />
Shall I pronounce it at the hour of death!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXIV"></a>XXIV<br />
<br />
<br />
Perhaps,<br />
On my last day,<br />
Perhaps,<br />
Across my window sill,<br />
The sunlight frail and still<br />
Will fall and for a moment stay....<br />
<br />
My hands&mdash;my hands then poor and witherèd&mdash;<br />
By its glory will be made to gold;<br />
Slowly its kiss will glide, profound and bright,<br />
For the last time upon my mouth and head;<br />
And the flowers of my eyes, pale yet bold,<br />
Before they close, shall render back its light.<br />
<br />
Sun, I loved your strength and clarity, indeed!<br />
My sweet and fiery poems at their height<br />
Have held you captive in the heart of them;<br />
Like field of wheat that surges in the might<br />
Of summer wind my words exalted you.<br />
Oh sun, who bring to birth and flower the stem,<br />
Oh immense friend, of whom our pride has need,<br />
In that so grave, imperious hour and new,<br />
When my old heart sadly endures the test,<br />
Be you still its witness and its guest!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXV"></a>XXV<br />
<br />
<br />
Clasped about my neck and harbouring my breast,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ah your so dear hands now and their slow caress,</span><br />
When I tell you, in the evening, how my strength<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Grows leaden day by day with weight of feebleness!</span><br />
<br />
You wish it not that 1 become shadow and ruin<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like all those who obey the gloomy night's behests,</span><br />
Though it be with laurel in their mournful hands<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And glory sleeping in their hollow breasts.</span><br />
<br />
Ah how time's harsh law is softened by your love<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And how your lovely dream disconsolate tears would stem;</span><br />
For the first and only time you nurse with lies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">My heart that finds excuse and gives you thanks for them.</span><br />
<br />
Which, however, knows all ardour is in vain<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Against what is and all that must be in the strife,</span><br />
And that perhaps there is profounder happiness<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To end thus in your eyes my lovely human life.</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a id="XXVI"></a>XXVI<br />
<br />
<br />
When you shall close these eyes of mine to light,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh kiss them long&mdash;for all that love afire</span><br />
May hope to give they shall have given you<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In that last look of ultimate desire.</span><br />
<br />
Beneath the moveless glow of candle light,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh lean to them your face so fain and brave</span><br />
That on them be impressed this sight alone<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That they shall keep forever in the grave.</span><br />
<br />
And may I feel, before the tomb is mine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Upon the pure, white bed our hands that seek</span><br />
Each other once again, and near my head<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Feel for the last time repose your cheek;</span><br />
<br />
And know that I shall go away with heart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Burning still for you so passionately</span><br />
That even through the mute and stony earth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The dead themselves shall feel its ardency!</span><br />

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER

WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
